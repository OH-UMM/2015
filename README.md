For future organizers:
You will likely want to make a fresh copy of this repository (name it after the current year) and modify it as you move forward. 
* **Registration** - Update the site. Making a new copy of this repo named 2016, for example, 
should give you a new copy with the url [http://oh-umm.github.io/**2016**/](http://oh-umm.github.io/2016/). 
Then you can modify the page, update the google forms and push these changes to 'gh-pages' branch of the project.

* **Content** - All of the content that we used has been linked on this repositoy's wiki. Several reveal.js 
presentations were created or adapted from the OpenHatch folks and they can be found in the slides directory.
